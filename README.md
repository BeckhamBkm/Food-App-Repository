# Food-App-Repository

# This app is a online food ordering app and it enables people to order food
# from any remote location and eliminates any waiting time as they get
# to just come pay and collect the food in person after it has been prepared
# and it solves the issues of having to qeue for a long period in the resurant waiting for your meal.

# The solution changed my perspective as I am currently using a new front-end language called flutter which is a cross platform 
# hosting platform for developing many languages and anables any Backend to support it as the front end uses Dart.

# My problem solving approach is that I am using a new hosting platform called firebase that provides real time database
# which is essential to my project and allows a secure access to the database and data is persisted locally and 
# it requires a small usage of legacy or third-party services.
